# BUber
## Outline for BUber taxi service on Nostr

Uber works well, apart from the Uber company.

BUber uses the https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr network to connect taxis and clients, in a permissionless way.

This example will be through a fictional https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits extension that acts as a nostr client software for a taxi driver and customer 

### Setup workflow:

User opens client and selects whether they are a taxi or customer, either choice issues Schnoor keypair, or they can add their own pre-existing keypair
